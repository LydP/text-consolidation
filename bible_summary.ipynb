    "This notebook shows the effects of using the long-form text consolidation and summarization functions I made in the consolidation-comparison.ipynb notebook on the Bible. I ran them on the whole Bible, the New Testament, the Old Testament, and each book. I've included the description of those techniques below for the sake of completeness. I did this purely out of curiosity; this is not meant to serve as any form of conclusive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "Term frequency-inverse document frequency gives high weights to words that are present in a given document (term frequency), but rare across the entire corpus (inverse document frequency). I wanted to explore the utility of using this techinque for consolidating long texts. I used the follow process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Turn text into a list of sentences.\n",
    "2. Create the sparse TF-IDF matrix from these sentences. Each sentence is a document, and the full collection of sentences is the corpus.\n",
    "3. Pool the vectors in this matrix using either max or sum pooling.\n",
    "    - Max pooling captures the maximum TF-IDF score for each word. Broadly speaking, this vector represents the text's most important topics.\n",
    "    - Sum pooling sums all TF-IDF scores for each word. Broadly speaking, this vector represents the text's recurring themes.\n",
    "5. Use MMR to select sentences based on their TF-IDF vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach uses sentence transformers in fundamentally the same process as I used for TF-IDF consolidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chunk text into either sentences or fixed-size chunks.\n",
    "2. Embed text chunks.\n",
    "3. Mean pool embeddings.\n",
    "4. Use MMR to select sentences based on their embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: `transformers_consolidation()` contains options for length weighted mean pooling and semantic centrality pooling, which aren't implemented in this notebook, but were implemented in another notebook not in this repository. Length weighted mean pooling finds the average of the vectors weighted by the length of the sentence each vector represents. Semantic centrality pooling weights each embedding by its average cosine similarity to all other embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hugging Face Summarization Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach iteratively summarizes long-form text using Hugging Face's summarization pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine token limit of summarization model.\n",
    "2. Chunk text into pieces ~50% of model's token limit.\n",
    "3. Summarize each chunk to 30-90% of its original length.\n",
    "4. Concatentate chunks.\n",
    "5. Repeat chunking and summarization process of concatenated text until concatenated text is within defined limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: `summarization_pipeline_consolidation()` contains options for paragraph chunking and semantic chunking, which aren't implemented in this notebook. Where `semantic_chunking()` is implemnented, it uses LangChain's SemanticChunker (`from langchain_experimental.text_splitter import SemanticChunker`). \n",
    "\n",
    "# Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot of text in this notebook, so I haven't read through all of it yet, but here are some of my more immediate observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- TF-IDF consolidation with max pooling produced identical results for the whole Bible and the Old Testament.\n",
    "- Transformers consolidation with chunk pooling produced very similar results for the whole Bible and the Old Testament. The only difference was a single sentence, \"And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood,\" which is present in the consolidation for the whole Bible but not the Old Testament.\n",
    "- Much of the text returned by `summarization_pipeline_consolidation()` is similar between the whole Bible and the Old Testament. The whole Bible summarization has several more sentences at the end, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect that the previous three observations simply result from the fact that the Old Testament is a much larger portion of the Bible than the New Testament. Changing the MMR lambda value may produce different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the inspiration for this project was curiosity about what would happen if I tried to condense the Bible into a single, discourse coherent paragraph. However, the summarization pipeline results overall seem too noisy to be usable in any meaningful way. They're better for the individual books, espeically the shorter ones, but not for the full testaments and the whole Bible. Iteratively summarizing text like I did opens up too many opportunities for artifacts to appear, which they certainly did. I'm sure I'd get usable results if I used one of the big LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) or did some careful model selection and parameter tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "I first tried to use the pegasus-x-large model because it produced such good results in the consolidation_comparison.ipynb notebook before it devolved into repetition. I thought that, with some parameter tuning, it could give me what I was hoping for. However, running it locally on the entire Bible proved too resource intensive (i.e. it was taking too long and I got impatient), so I opted for sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6, which produced sufficiently passable results in the other notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind with these results is that, due to the nature of NLP, these results are semantically important, but not necessarily theologically important. Studying the overlap between semantic and theological importance could be an an interesting project for later."

A Psalm of David was written by David David, the chief Musician of the Bible . Shiggaion of David is a Psalm for the people who put their trust in thee and defend them . The Psalm contains a list of Psalms from the Bible, which includes Psalms about God and his people . It is said to be one of the most popular versions of the Psalms in the world .

Rahab the harlot hid messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho, and she hid them . But she said, I know that the LORD  Moses spake unto Joshua, saying , Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan . And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the arks of the LORD passed over . The children of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed  In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof . So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken . And he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:  And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones . All the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it  The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones .  There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained . So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . This is the land that still remaineth  Moses distributed for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward . But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance . The name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Ankims . Even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast  Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD . The second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the  children of Benjamin according to his families . The third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families . And the seventh lot came out for the tribes of Dan and Naphtali . And then the coast turneth to Ramah and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turnedeth to Hosah . From thence passeth on on on the east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah . Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead  Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the Son of Beor to curse you . But I would not hearken unto Balaaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand . Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth . '"

And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:  Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me. So they two went until they come to Bethlehem .  Naomi gleaned an ephah of barley, and took it up, and went into the city . Her mother in law saw what she had gleaned, and gave it to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed . Then she said, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? And Boaz said, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done  since the death of thine husband . The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust. Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:  Let thine Eyes be on the field that they do reap, and  Ruth the Moabitess kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest . Naomi her mother in law said, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? And Naomi said, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field . So she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her to do . When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at a heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down . And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid  Naomi, a kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here . And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself . But if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee . And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law. Then said, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day . The woman rose up before one could know another. She went into the city  Boaz bought all that was Elimelech's, Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi . Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance . So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception,. and she bare a son . And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it . And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father for Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king . He prepared chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him . But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not . Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying: Hast thou not heard that Adon Elijah doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? Then Bathsheaba bowed with her face to the earth, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever .  Solomon was building his own house 13 years, and he finished all his house . He overlaid the house within with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar . The height of the one cherubim was ten cubits, and so was it of the other . Both the cherubims were of one measure and one size . And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of  cedar beams . For the entering of the temple he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall . So also made he for the door of the Temple posts of olive Tree, a fourth part of an olive tree . And the two doors also were of fir tree : the two leaves of Fir  Three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD . The weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold . Pharaoh\\'s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her . Rezon the son of Eliadah was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria . And Jeroboam lifted up his hand against Solomon\\'s servant, whose mother\\'s mother\\'s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up their hand against the king . He had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram, bringing gold   The word of the LORD came to pass as the prophet that brought him back from the way heard . He said, \"Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers\" After this thing Jeroboom returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and became one of the priests of a high places . And this thing became sin unto the house of Jerobam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from the face of the earth . Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asasan\\'s reign  Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines .  Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him: and Ahab went to met Elijah . He said, As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee . When they said, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not . Elisha the son of Shaphat was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth . He left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee . And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God .  Ahaziah began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehosaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel .

For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.

For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand. And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made. Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;\n",

And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter. now what is thy petition? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?\n",

And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,\n",

Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring. And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,\n",

In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;\n",
      "  All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days. Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.\n",

On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,\n",
      "  To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on. Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people. Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment? After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.\n"

       "' A Psalm of David was written by the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith . He sang it to the people in Shiggaion of David, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite . My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD . There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? But the LORD, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill . Have mercy upon me, O Lord, consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:  A Psalm of David was written by the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, a Psalm . The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels . In it, he says: \"Let the people praise thee, O God,\" then the earth will yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us\" But I am a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother\\'s children . For the zeal of thine house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me . When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach,  Solomon: \"I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD\" He says: “Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked  A Psalm of David to be read by the chief Musician, a book written by David\\'s son-in-law .

So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man . Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids . Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry . If he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house . He that hid hatred with lying lips, and he uttereth a slander, is a fool  Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to counsellors of peace is joy . Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight . As righteousness tendeth to life, so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death . Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner . A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger . A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good . Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness . The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish . Delight   The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly . It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity . A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold . Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:  Lest thou learn his ways  When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee:  And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite . Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat . If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat  Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:  Remove far from me vanity and lies: Give me neither poverty nor riches . Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness . Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies . '"

All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing . One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever . There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that will come after . I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge . So I was great, and increased more than all   I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work . Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter . Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the Sun . This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. Better is an handful with quietness, than both hands full with travail and  There is one alone, and there is not a second; yet is there no end of all his labour . Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better . The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning  There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not . Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city . A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed . But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God . Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the years of your vanity . Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works. Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment  This wisdom have I seen also under the Sun, and it seemed great unto me:  There was a little city, and few men within it . Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place . He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him . If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences . Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! \""

The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein. But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan. And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD. O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God.\n",

He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away . Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth . Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O Ye vinedressers, for the  A great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations . The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run . They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways . And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word . But who can abide it? Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting ...  And rend your heart,. and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God . He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness  Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring . And I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea . And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed . Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your God? Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:  Gather the people, sanctifying the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children  The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come . And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke . And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:  And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out My spirit.

Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, awake the mighty men, let all the men of war  The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining . The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem . Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great. Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathens round about .

And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it. Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD. how are his hidden things sought up! If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.\n"

These are they  I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem .  The word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu . And he said, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it . And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork . And then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said, Lift up now thine eyes, ... And I said, What is it? And I see a flying woman . He said, 'This is wickedness. And I will bring them, and they shall be my people, and I will be their God'  The seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the heavens shall give their dew . And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judges, so will I save you . And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets . And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines . And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and  I will remove his blood from his mouth . Rejoice greatly, O . daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee . And they shall fight, because the LORD is with them  Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me . Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that that is to be cut off, let the rest eat every one the flesh of another . In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left . And Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem . The day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee . All the land from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem will be lifted up, and inhabited in her place .  The wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance . So shall be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD'S house shall be like the bowls before the altar . And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem . \""

He breathed on them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them . They were amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Joel says God will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire . And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh . A vision appeared to Paul in the night; there stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia,  and help us .

There is therefore no condemnation to those which are in ChristJesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit . Some with conscience of idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled . Owe no man any thing, but to love one another .

       "' The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of Holy Ghost . And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and  after they had been brought to\\xa0Babylon\\xa0are 14 generations . So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations . But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said, Arise, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the little child\\'s life . Then Joseph arose, and took the small child and its mother, and came into the Land of Israel . Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water  Jesus said, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord . He said, \\'I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves . When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come . But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;  And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake . A woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment  The kingdom is like unto a net cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind . When it was full, gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away . Jesus said, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own city, and in his house . He charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus . After six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart . And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light . Then said, \"There be some standing here which shall not taste death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom\" His disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread  The last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen . Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess . And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not . The kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods . Jesus said, \\'There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall never be thrown down\\'  One of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, and said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver . From that time he sought opportunity to betray him . As they did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me . Peter answered and said: Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended . Then shall the kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom . But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps . While they went to buy, they all slumbered and slept. They that were foolish took no oil with their oils '"

He rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still .  When the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee .

And they reasoned among themselves, saying: It is because we have no bread . After six days Jesus was transfigured, his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow .  Blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging for mercy on Jesus . The Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection, asked him to explain why .

For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many . The end shall not be yet, but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved . Many bare false witness against Jesus to put him to death, but their witness agreed not together .  Pilate bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock . Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid . But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you . In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;  They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them . Amen . \""

       "\" The Bible says Jesus was the son and father of a group of men and women . He explains how the Bible's creation of the Bible changed the way God dealt with the birth of Jesus Christ . In fact, the Bible had no conception of Jesus as an adult when he became a man and godfather . It says that Jesus was born into a family of men, not just children, but adults; they were also parents . They are responsible for the Bible’s origin; it says: “The Bible” – A generation of people have come to their faith . We say that the Bible contains many passages from the Bible . Some of them are believed to have fallen away from its teachings . And Jesus is the son who has been with the world since he came to his first appearance in the Bible  Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias' When the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when famine was  He laid his hands on every one of the sick with divers diseases, and healed them . And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, 'Thrill Christ the Son of God . And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power . Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him, and hurt him not . But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation . Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven . Your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest .  A man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child . And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him . Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father . Then went the devils out of the man, and entered  When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country . Then they went to Jesus, and found the man at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind . They also which saw it told them by what means he that was healed  So is \\xa0so is he who lays up treasure in treasure for themselves, and isn't rich toward ...

It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden . Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say, will seek to enter into, and shall not be able . There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob  A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time . But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him . So they cast him out of the vineyard,. and killed him . And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?

As for Saul, he made havock of the church,  Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost .

They shook off  Paul and Barnabas  After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;  And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla . He reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks .

If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise . The body is not for fornication,  Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornicated sinneth against his own body . Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?  I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily . I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:  Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an known tongue . If the whole church be come together into one place, and all speaking with tongues, will they not say that ye are mad? But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believe not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all . And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth . The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .

Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have . For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:  But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance might be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be another supply for your want:  There may be equality . The Bible says  Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many  I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ . Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted? I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service . But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile . Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves . The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not . Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was beaten with rods, once was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep sea  The second epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi, a city of Macedonia, by Titus and Lucas .

       "' To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;  Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;  When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also . Be not ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God . All they which are in Asia be turned away from me  No man that warreth entangle himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier . And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully . Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth . But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness . Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart . The things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised  Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me . Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness . That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. I charge thee therefore before God,  Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. And the servant of the Lord must not strive  The second epistle unto Timotheus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the second time . Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: for I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand . For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears . And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.  For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica . '"

       "\" James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;  Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience . If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways. Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:  But the rich, in that they are made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. For the sun is no sooner  If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain . Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world . For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass:  For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. But whosoever looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doe of the work,. this man shall be blessed in his deed  Abraham was justified by works, not by faith only . For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also . Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God . If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,  And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, be ... what doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead  There is confusion and every evil work where envying and strife is, there is confusion . The wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish . From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? But he giveth more grace unto the humble . Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and it will draw close to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning  There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you . Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire . Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Grudge not one against another, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. The husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain . But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,  Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months . Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed . The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death . \""

For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit . But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer . And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins . Use hospitality one to another without grudging. As every man receives the gift, even so minister the same one toAnother, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God . Amen.  If any man speak, let him speak  The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind . Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you . Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:  Whom resist stedfast in the faith . '"

For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that they should love one another. Not as Cain ...

Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:  And every spirit who confesseth not that Jesus\\xa0is not of God is not a prophet . Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, which we might live through him  If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us .

I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.\n"

Amen.\""
